### Plan+Venture
###### _Prime Digital Academy Solo Project_
Author: Connor O'Gara

#### Project Requirements
As part of the Prime Digital Academy curriculum, students must create a full stack solo project in a two week period. The student will create a web app with the functionality of their choosing.

#### Application Overview
Plan+Venture is a full-stack web application to organize camping and backpacking trips with a group of users. It allows users to create new trips or join existing trips. The group organizer is able to provide an access code to individuals to allow them to become a part of the trip. Within each trip, users can modify their gear, take responsibility for group equipment that may be required, or suggest additional gear that may be needed. In addition, the menu page will be dynamically created based on the duration of the trip; each meal in each day can be individually modified. Once the trip is planned, there is a print page that prints each individualâ€™s responsibilities for packing as a checklist.
